## Implementation / Hands-on
- Coding models in PyTorch ([stable diffusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBKpAp_6TGI&ab_channel=UmarJamil), [LLM transformer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=41s&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy))
- Code [DiT architecture](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DiT) from scratch based on the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09748) using only the trainer and diffusion module (no using LLMs for help)

## Notes & Advice
- Rewatch/re-read things you didn't get initially after some time — progress is real but gradual.  
- Use ChatGPT / LLMs to help explain papers and math (use cautiously; don't over-rely).  
- My blog on how to do AI research (coming soon — feel free to ask me for the draft)
